			 <H2> Photo Album of Sandy Ridge Villa</H2> 
			 <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">This brand new villa is a 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom
				property with heated pool and spa. It lies just 10 minutes from Disney. The
				property sleeps 12 and is ideal for multiple family vacation (12 using queen
				sofa bed in living room). It has two master bedrooms (One with King bed &amp;
				one with Queen bed) and both have en-suites and TVs. Additionally we have two
				queen bedrooms and a twin bedroom. It has a spacious living room with cable TV
				&amp; DVD, a large dining area, and a fully fitted kitchen with breakfast table
				set. Outside the house there is screened, heated pool with Jacuzzi and extended
				decking area with child safety fence. We have carefully furnished our villa to
				a very high standard and designed it specifically to ensure we have provided
				everything you need for a wonderful holiday. The Sandy Ridge is a new community
				which has been developed with vacationers in mind. It is next to reunion Golf
				course. It is ideally located for Disney World visiting and yet still provides
				space and relaxation thanks to the conservation areas that surround the
				community. </FONT></B></P>
